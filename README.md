# SampleSearch
SampleSearch was the world's first 'file based' sound effects and sample library search for macOS created in 1992, it became an industry standard in the Music Business and the Film and TV industry during the 1990s

Prior to SampleSearch, all samples and sound effects libraries were based on audio CDs or CDRoms with some rudimentary databases to search for sounds, followed by the manual process of loading the CD and sampling the sound into your sampler or (later) copying from CD Rom to computer.

Due to the limited size of Hard Disc storage available at the time SampleSearch allowed users to 'scan' their CDRoms into 'ghost' files which were snapshots of the CD Rom and then search all ghost files, along with any hard discs in one search, returning results which could be auditioned immediately (if on a hard disc) or prompted to insert a specfic CDRom.  These files would then automatically copy from CDRom and could be loaded automatically into SampleCell, Sound Designer II and later Pro Tools. SampleSearch originally shipped with CDStudio which allowed users to 'rip' their sound effects CDs into files, including sub track indexes. 

SampleSearch's wide array of audio (batch) processing tools and the instant waveform selector lead to its use in many of the early 'Multimedia' projects, typically released on CDRom, and early interactive games which contained thousands of audio files, trimmed and processed.  It was also used along with Gallery's VoicePro application on production of one of the first 'speaking dictionary' projects, where every word in the dictionary was recorded by a speaker.

In this repository are binary versions for OS9 for PPC (and perhaps 68k ?) and OSX (for PPC using classic up to OSX 10.4.11). These special versions have had the copy protection removed so they can live in the wild where orphaned old macs still roam.

Note that these files are here for posterity and no warranties, or any type of support or advice are available.
